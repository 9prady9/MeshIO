# MeshIO
# -----
#
# This is the cmake configuration file for MeshIO header library. It provides
# the following imported targets.
#
# ``MeshIO::meshio`` - the target for MeshIO
#
# This target can be used to link with your application using the
# ``target_link_library`` command. Here is an example of how to use these
# targets in your application:
#
#   add_executable(mybinary source.cpp)
#   target_link_library(mybinary PRIVATE MeshIO::meshio)
#
# This example creates a mybinary executable from the source.cpp file and links
# against the MeshIO library. Note you do *not* need to set the include
# directories as they are automatically included with the target.
#
# This is the recommended way of linking against MeshIO
